Australia's inaugural 2024 National Colony Loss Survey, covering the 2023-24 season, based on 997 responses from beekeepers managing 121,802 colonies found a national overall colony loss rate of 1.55%, one of the world's lowest. This figure establishes a "fragile baseline" for the Varroa-free majority of the country. This low national average, however, masks a stark divide revealed in New South Wales, where Varroa was officially established during the time of the survey. 

In New South Wales for amateur beekeepers Varroa was the single highest cause of cool-season losses (5.60%). For commercial beekeepers ($\ge 50$ hives), it was the second-highest cause of loss in both the cool season (0.82%) and warm season (1.35%)  

A major finding was the significant economic burden of the mite, with NSW beekeepers spending an average of $21.00 and 23.5 minutes per hive on Varroa management. Regarding treatments, beekeepers perceived synthetic miticides like Bayvarol and Apivar as the most effective with the fewest adverse effects. However, it should be noted that while Varroa in Australia is currently sensitive to synthetic miticides, resistance evolves quickly. Careful adherence to miticide application protocols and immediate adoption of Integrated Pest Management to prevent rapid resistance is needed.
