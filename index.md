The **2024 Honey Bee Colony Loss Survey** is led by a consortium of researchers and representatives from the Australian Honey Bee Industry. Your participation is crucial in identifying beekeeping trends and assessing the impact of Varroa. Whether or not your hives have been affected, your insights will help measure Varroaâ€™s effects in established areas.  

This **takes approximately 7 minutes for small operators and 15 minutes for commercial beekeepers**. The questions are straightforward, though you may need to refer to your records. Your input is invaluable in shaping a clearer picture of beekeeping challenges and resilience. 

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to [contact us](mailto:coloss@anu.edu.au).
