<!-- The **Honey Bee Colony Loss Survey** is led by a consortium of researchers and representatives from the Australian Honey Bee Industry. The 2025 Survey has launched and will run through November 1st! [**Take it now!**](/2025-survey). Your participation is crucial in identifying beekeeping trends and assessing the impact of Varroa. Whether or not your hives have been affected, your insights will help measure Varroa’s effects in established areas.  

The survey **takes approximately 7 minutes for small operators and 15 minutes for commercial beekeepers** to fill out. The questions are straightforward, though you may need to refer to your records. Your input is invaluable in shaping a clearer picture of beekeeping challenges and resilience. 

**2024 Survey Results Available**: Australia's inaugural colony loss survey results are now published, showing a national loss rate of 1.55% - one of the world's lowest. However, the data reveals significant regional differences, particularly in NSW where Varroa has established. [View the full 2024 results](/2024-survey-results/).

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to [contact us](mailto:coloss@anu.edu.au). -->

The 2025 Australian Colony Loss survey will be released in early 2026. Please check back then to view the results and findings.
