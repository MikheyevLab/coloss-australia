The 2024 colony loss survey is being undertaken by a consortium of researchers and Australian Honey Bee Industry representatives. Your participation makes it possible to identify trends in Australian beekeeping and to understand better the impact Varroa is having. Bringing together the experience of beekeepers, this survey will also show what countermeasures are working across Australia. This **survey covers 2024 and takes about 7 minutes for small operators and ~15 minutes for commercial beekeepers**. The questions are easy to answer but may require you to look up some of your records.
